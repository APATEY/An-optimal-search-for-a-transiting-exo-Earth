# An-optimal-search-for-a-transiting-exo-Earth
Here can be found the set of python code files used in the paper <i>An optimal search for a transiting exo-Earth</i>, aiming to explore the survey strategy consisting in targetting M dwarfs hosting one or more TESS transiting candidates, with ground photometry/Radial velocity surveys.

## How to use it
The files only work together, as they call each other. Clone them locally in the same directory.
Examples for a basic usage can be found in a jupyter notebook coming soon. Furthermore, the whole code is commented, so that anyone may understand how it works in detail.
A way to change some parameters arbitrarily fixed in the article can be found in the <i>further.txt</i> file.
